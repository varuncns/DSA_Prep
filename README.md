# DSA Prep

This repository contains Java implementations of common sorting algorithms as part of a data structures and algorithms preparation series.

## Sorting Algorithms

- **Bubble Sort** – `Sorting/bubbleSort.java`
- **Insertion Sort** – `Sorting/insertionSort.java`
- **Merge Sort** – `Sorting/mergeSorting.java`
- **Quick Sort** – `Sorting/quickSorting.java`
- **Selection Sort** – `Sorting/selectionSort.java`

Each file includes inline comments explaining the time and space complexities of the algorithm.

Feel free to contribute by improving implementations or adding new algorithms.
